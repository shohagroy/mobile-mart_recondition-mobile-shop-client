If the user creates a seller account, he will choose the seller option. Otherwise, a normal user will have the user option selected by default. Users logged in by using social media will be considered as buyers.

Customer will see: My Booking

Sellers will see:My Booking, Add A product ,  My Products,  

Admin will see: All Sellers, All Buyers, All Product

- ### `Add a product`
8. On the " Add A Product" route, create a form that will have fields for product name, price, condition type, mobile number, location, product category (every product should be under a category), description, price, Year of purchase and other relevant information. After submitting the form, a modal with a message will pop up to inform the user. Please remember, they must be a seller to add a product (think about the verification process for the admin access). After adding the product, you will then be redirected to the My Products Page.


- ### `my product`
On the "My Products" page, display sales status (available or sold), any other relevant information you want to show. A seller will be able to delete any of his/her product. there will be a advertise button for each unsold/available product where the seller can hit the button to advertise.

- ### `advertised`
The advertised items will appear on the home page. if there are no items marked as advertised, the advertised items section won't be displayed on the home page. The advertised section will only appear if there is one or more available (unsold items) are marked to be advertised.


In the All Sellers, the Admin will see the sellers. On the All Buyers route, the Admin can see all the Buyers. If the Admin wants, he can delete any buyers or sellers.

On the navbar, there will be a Blogs route. This will be an open route (anyone visiting your website will see it). There have some question and answer.

Have a meaningful 404 page (not found page). Add a animation image on the 404 page.

Use a database to store information. It could be MongoDB atlas. Save the users in the database

If data is loading, a spinner will be displayed. When you are loading data by using a loader, make sure you have added a route.


Implement an feature Cart. A buyer can make a product to his/her cart or report an item by clicking a cart button. If you have implemented the wishlist feature, show them in the buyer's Dashboard in a separate route, A user should be able to purchase the item from the wishlist page. (Just redirect the user to the purchase page)

- ### `footer section`
After that we have our footer section, the footer section is designed in a simple way, there is a little information about the company name.
